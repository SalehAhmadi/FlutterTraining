# Time Tracker Flutter Course Training
My Flutter Training

These training files are based on the Udemy course that I've passed.
Feel free to use them.

## Running the project with Firebase

This project uses the following package name (case sensitive):

- `com.codingwithflutter.timetrackerfluttercourse` on Android
- `com.codingwithflutter.timeTrackerFlutterCourse` on iOS

You can clone this repo and reuse this package name if you want, but you will need to register the project with your on Firebase account.

Once this is done, you can download the `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` and `android/app/google-services.json` files from your Firebase project settings as needed.
